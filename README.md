# Sudoku
Sudoku is a game where a user is not allowed to insert the same number twice in a row or column or in a single square on the board. The purpose of this game is to make humans improve their critical thinking skills and brain power. As part of my assignments for class I will be exploring how to impelement a Sudoku Solver using the brute force algorithm.
